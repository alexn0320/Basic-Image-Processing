* Implements basic image processing algorithms on bitmaps, such as grayscale, pixelation, setting and getting the values of a pixel and convolution (more to be implemented). 
* No frameworks where used, bitmaps are opened as a binary file and header/pixel data are read directly, while algorithms are implemented in C.

Very useful info on bitmaps: [Bitmap file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format).
